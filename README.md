# cads-notebooks

Notebooks useful for the CADS datasets.

## datasets/

This folder contains notebooks which are relevent to specific datasets. Primarily the notebooks used to create
the overview images used by the web-portal.

## documentation/

This folder contains notebooks which help explain various backend processes that are done by the CADS
(for example the GRIB to NetCDF conversion), and/or to advise users on how to do certain computations
(for example, how to compute the daily accumulation of the ERA5-land variables). Generally, these notebooks
are referenced and embeded in more user friendly documentation pages, but feel free to explore here.
